**Mathematical modelling of COVID-19 Data: The Reopening Of Schools In Jamaica During The Covid 19 Pandemic**

 <div align="justify"> 

**Introduction:** This paper seeks to study the effectiveness of modelling COVID-19 pandemic by developing an
adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model that provides a theoretical framework to investigate its spread
within Jamaica, and how this can address the policy decision of when schools can be reopened for face-to-face
classes, without full depletion of hospital capacity. **Methods:** The adapted model incorporates differences in disease
transmission between children (less than 18 years old), vaccination and death due to infection. Parameters specific to
transmission between adults and students were developed. Data for infected, hospitalized as a subset of infected,
dead, vaccinated and recovered populations over weekly periods from September 2021 to November 2021were
collected from the Ministry of Health and Wellness of Jamaica and Johns Hopkins University COVID Map. A
system of five(5) equations was developed, and Matlab 2019b was utilized as the solver for the differential
equations. **Results:** Graphs of population as a function of time were generated for two events: 65% of students
becoming vaccinated; and 50% of students being integrated into face-to-face school; with the hospitalized
population as the projected outcome. **Conclusion:** The results indicated that once 65% of vaccination is achieved,
schools can return to full reopening as the projected hospitalized population is unlikely to exceed the threshold.
